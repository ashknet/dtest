# Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to implement pagination step by step. Check off each item as you complete it.

---

## Phase 1: Understanding & Planning

### □ 1.1 Understand the Problem
- [ ] Read **README.md** for overview
- [ ] Understand that 1,479 engagements in one response is causing the issue
- [ ] Review **VISUAL_DIAGRAM.md** to see the problem visually
- [ ] Confirm that pagination should be applied to the `engagements` field

### □ 1.2 Choose Your Implementation Language
- [ ] JavaScript/Node.js → Use `pagination_implementation_examples.js`
- [ ] Python → Use `pagination_implementation_examples.py`
- [ ] Other language → Adapt the logic from the examples above

### □ 1.3 Gather Credentials
- [ ] Obtain MAT GraphQL API endpoint URL
- [ ] Obtain MAT API authentication token
- [ ] Verify you have permissions to access the API
- [ ] Test basic API connectivity (curl or Postman)

**Deliverable:** You have API credentials and understand the problem.

---

## Phase 2: Testing Pagination Support

### □ 2.1 Set Up Test Environment
- [ ] Clone or download the test script:
  - JavaScript: `test_pagination.js`
  - Python: `test_pagination.py`
- [ ] Set environment variables:
  ```bash
  export MAT_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT="your_endpoint_url"
  export MAT_API_TOKEN="your_token"
  ```
- [ ] Or update the CONFIG section in the test script

### □ 2.2 Run Tests
- [ ] Run the test script:
  ```bash
  node test_pagination.js
  # or
  python test_pagination.py
  ```
- [ ] Review the output to see which pagination methods are supported

### □ 2.3 Document Results
- [ ] **Offset-based (skip/take):** ✅ Supported / ❌ Not Supported
- [ ] **Cursor-based (first/after):** ✅ Supported / ❌ Not Supported
- [ ] Note the recommendation from the test output

**Deliverable:** You know which pagination method to use.

---

## Phase 3: Update GraphQL Query

### □ 3.1 Backup Your Current Query
- [ ] Save a copy of your current working query
- [ ] Document the current behavior (errors, timeouts, etc.)

### □ 3.2 Update Query for Offset-Based Pagination (if using)
- [ ] Add `skip: $skip` parameter to `engagements` field
- [ ] Add `take: $take` parameter to `engagements` field
- [ ] Add `$skip: Int!` to query parameters
- [ ] Add `$take: Int!` to query parameters
- [ ] Refer to **BEFORE_AND_AFTER_COMPARISON.md** for exact syntax

### □ 3.3 Update Query for Cursor-Based Pagination (if using)
- [ ] Add `first: $first` parameter to `engagements` field
- [ ] Add `after: $after` parameter to `engagements` field
- [ ] Wrap engagement fields in `edges { node { ... } }`
- [ ] Add `pageInfo { hasNextPage, endCursor }` to response
- [ ] Add `totalCount` to response (optional but helpful)
- [ ] Add `$first: Int!` to query parameters
- [ ] Add `$after: String` to query parameters
- [ ] Refer to **BEFORE_AND_AFTER_COMPARISON.md** for exact syntax

**Deliverable:** Updated GraphQL query with pagination parameters.

---

## Phase 4: Implement Pagination Logic

### □ 4.1 Choose Implementation Approach
- [ ] Review code in `pagination_implementation_examples.js` or `.py`
- [ ] Decide whether to copy the entire function or adapt to existing code
- [ ] Understand the loop logic (while hasMore / while hasNextPage)

### □ 4.2 Implement Offset-Based (if using)
- [ ] Initialize: `skip = 0`, `allEngagements = []`, `hasMore = true`
- [ ] Create loop: `while (hasMore)`
- [ ] Make API call with current `skip` and `take` values
- [ ] Extract engagements from response
- [ ] Append to `allEngagements` array
- [ ] Check if response length < page size → set `hasMore = false`
- [ ] Otherwise, increment `skip` by `pageSize`
- [ ] Add logging to track progress

### □ 4.3 Implement Cursor-Based (if using)
- [ ] Initialize: `cursor = null`, `allEngagements = []`, `hasNextPage = true`
- [ ] Create loop: `while (hasNextPage)`
- [ ] Make API call with `first` and current `cursor`
- [ ] Extract edges from response
- [ ] Extract engagement nodes from edges
- [ ] Append nodes to `allEngagements` array
- [ ] Update `cursor` from `pageInfo.endCursor`
- [ ] Update `hasNextPage` from `pageInfo.hasNextPage`
- [ ] Add logging to track progress

### □ 4.4 Reconstruct Complete Response
- [ ] Store client-level data from first request
- [ ] Store clientProfile-level data from first request
- [ ] Combine all engagements from all pages
- [ ] Reconstruct original response structure:
  ```javascript
  {
    data: {
      clients: [{
        // client fields
        clientProfiles: [{
          // profile fields
          engagements: allEngagements  // Combined from all pages
        }]
      }]
    }
  }
  ```

### □ 4.5 Add Error Handling
- [ ] Wrap API calls in try/catch blocks
- [ ] Handle HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx)
- [ ] Handle GraphQL errors
- [ ] Handle network timeouts
- [ ] Log errors with context (request number, cursor, etc.)
- [ ] Decide on retry strategy (optional)

**Deliverable:** Working pagination implementation.

---

## Phase 5: Testing

### □ 5.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Test with page size = 10 (small, for debugging)
- [ ] Verify loop iterates correct number of times
- [ ] Verify all engagements are collected
- [ ] Verify no duplicates
- [ ] Test error handling (invalid credentials, etc.)

### □ 5.2 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with page size = 500 (production value)
- [ ] Test with actual client ID and fiscal year
- [ ] Verify total count matches expected (1,479 engagements)
- [ ] Verify response structure matches original format
- [ ] Measure response time for each request
- [ ] Verify memory usage is reasonable

### □ 5.3 Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with different page sizes (100, 250, 500, 1000)
- [ ] Test with client that has fewer engagements than page size
- [ ] Test with client that has zero engagements
- [ ] Test with invalid client ID
- [ ] Test with network interruption (if possible)

### □ 5.4 Validation
- [ ] Compare paginated results with original (if available)
- [ ] Verify all engagement fields are present
- [ ] Verify nested objects (parentEngagement, pso, etc.) are intact
- [ ] Check for data consistency across pages

**Deliverable:** Fully tested pagination implementation.

## Phase 6: Performance Optimization (Optional)

### □ 6.1 Determine Optimal Page Size
- [ ] Test with page sizes: 250, 500, 750, 1000
- [ ] Measure response time for each
- [ ] Measure memory usage for each
- [ ] Choose optimal balance:
  - Smaller = more API calls but faster per call
  - Larger = fewer API calls but slower per call
- [ ] Document chosen page size and reasoning

### □ 6.2 Add Progress Tracking
- [ ] Log progress after each page: "Fetched 500/1479 (33%)"
- [ ] Implement progress callback for UI updates (if needed)
- [ ] Add estimated time remaining (optional)

### □ 6.3 Add Caching (Optional)
- [ ] Cache complete results for X minutes
- [ ] Implement cache key based on client ID + fiscal year

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Pagination query fails
- [ ] Verify query syntax matches MAT API requirements
- [ ] Check test results to confirm which pagination method is supported
- [ ] Review API error messages
- [ ] Refer to **BEFORE_AND_AFTER_COMPARISON.md** for correct syntax

### Issue: Missing engagements
- [ ] Verify loop continues until all pages are fetched
- [ ] Check that `hasMore` / `hasNextPage` logic is correct
- [ ] Add logging to see how many items are fetched per page
- [ ] Compare total count with expected count

### Issue: Duplicate engagements
- [ ] For cursor-based: ensure you're using the `endCursor` correctly
- [ ] For offset-based: verify `skip` is incrementing correctly
- [ ] Check that you're not re-fetching the same page

### Issue: Performance is slow
- [ ] Try different page sizes (smaller or larger)
- [ ] Check network latency to MAT API
- [ ] Verify you're not making redundant requests
- [ ] Consider implementing parallel requests (advanced)

### Issue: Memory issues
- [ ] Reduce page size
- [ ] Process engagements in chunks rather than storing all in memory
- [ ] Use streaming if available
- [ ] Verify you're not leaking memory in the loop
